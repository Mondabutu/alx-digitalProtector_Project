#Alx-digitalProtector Project Task
##Project Name: Digital Image Protection Management System

####Introduction
*This project helps digital image creators like Architects, photographers, Informatics, and Logo Designers, amongst others to protect their intellectual properties while rendering their services.
*The project was carried out by me out of my passion to solve proprietary problems. I have designed several logos, Informatics, and Graphics designs and have seen my work replicated without my approval.
*I saw this portfolio project as a time to research and find solutions for not just myself but others as well.
*They are several approaches to solving data integrity issues but Invisible watermarking protection captured my interest.
